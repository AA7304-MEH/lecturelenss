# 🚀 LectureLens Deployment Guide - UPDATED FIX

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Secret Reference Error Fix

### 🔧 IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:

1. **Delete your current Vercel project** (if deployment keeps failing)
2. **Create a new Vercel project** from scratch
3. **Follow the steps below exactly**

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [x] GitHub repository set up (✅ Already done)
- [x] Vercel account
- [x] Environment variables ready

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Deployment (FIXED VERSION)

### Method 1: Fresh Vercel Project (Recommended)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click "Add New" → "Project"

2. **Import from GitHub**
   - Select your repository: `AA7304-MEH/lecturelens`
   - Click "Import"

3. **Configure Project Settings**
   ```
   Project Name: lecturelens (or any valid name)
   Framework: Next.js (auto-detected)
   Root Directory: ./ (default)
   Build Command: npm run build (auto-detected)
   Output Directory: .next (auto-detected)
   Install Command: npm install (auto-detected)
   ```


5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for build to complete
   - You'll get a live URL like: `https://lecturelens-xxx.vercel.app`

### Method 2: Fix Existing Project

If you want to keep your existing project:

1. **Go to Project Settings**
   - Click on your project → Settings → Environment Variables

2. **Delete ALL existing environment variables**
   - Remove any variables that might have @ symbols or secret references

3. **Add the 3 variables above** (exact names and values)

4. **Go to Deployments tab**
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
   - Select "Use existing Build Cache: No"

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] File upload works
- [ ] AI summarization processes correctly
- [ ] History page shows saved summaries
- [ ] No console errors in browser

## 🔄 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Secret Reference Error
**Solution**: The error means Vercel is looking for secrets. Our `vercel.json` is clean, so this usually means:
1. Old cached configuration
2. Environment variables with @ symbols
3. Hidden secret references

**Fix**: Create a fresh Vercel project or clear all environment variables and re-add them.

### Issue: Build Fails
**Check**:
- All 3 environment variables are set
- Values are copied exactly (no extra spaces)
- All environments selected (Prod, Preview, Dev)

### Issue: API Routes Not Working
**Check**:
- Environment variables are in Production environment
- API keys are valid and not expired
- CORS headers are configured (already done in vercel.json)

## 🎯 Final URL

Your successful deployment URL will be: `https://lecturelens-[random].vercel.app`
